We are graduate researchers in the [Sonification Lab](http://sonify.psych.gatech.edu/) at [Georgia Tech](https://scs.gatech.edu/), studying and engineering diverse forms of intelligence.

Our work focuses on creating AI systems and tools that help measure, train, and facilitate interactions across difference — including humans with atypical sensory or cognitive profiles (such as neurodivergence), bioengineered organisms, basal intelligence systems like cellular collectives, and other nontraditional intelligences.
